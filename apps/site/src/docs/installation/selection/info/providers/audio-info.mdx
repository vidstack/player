You can use this provider to build an audio player. This provider uses the native `<audio>`
element to support [audio codecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs)
such as AAC, MP3, FLAC, etc. Do note, the type of audio codec supported is completely dependent
on the browser so use the prior link as reference to see what's supported.
