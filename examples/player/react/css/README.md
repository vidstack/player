# Player: React (CSS)

This example demonstrates setting up your custom video player layout with CSS using Vidstack Player
React.

The CSS option we're building on provides you with a minimal starting point and completely
unstyled components. All components including the player itself provide styling hooks via data
attributes and support animations. This option is best when you want to build your player yourself
from scratch using vanilla CSS.
