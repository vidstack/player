# Player: React (Radix + Tailwind CSS)

This example demonstrates setting up your custom video player layout with [Radix][radix],
[Lucide Icons][lucide], and [Tailwind CSS][tailwind] using Vidstack Player React.

The [Tailwind][tailwind] option we're building on provides you with a minimal starting point and
completely unstyled components. All components including the player itself provide styling hooks
via data attributes and support animations. Our [optional plugin][tailwind-plugin] can help speed
you up even more by providing you with easy to use media variants such as `media-paused:opacity-0`.
