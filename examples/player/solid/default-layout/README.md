# Player: Solid (Default Layout)

The [Default Layout][default-layout] is our production-ready player UI. If you're looking for
something pre-designed and ready out of the box then this is the best option. You can easily
customize the icons, branding, colors, and components to your liking.

This example demonstrates setting up and customizing the Default Layout using Vidstack Player
Web Components with Solid JS.
