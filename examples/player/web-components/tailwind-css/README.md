# Player: Web Components (Tailwind CSS)

The [Tailwind][tailwind] option provides you with a minimal starting point and completely unstyled
components. All components including the player itself provide styling hooks via data attributes and
support animations. Our [optional plugin][tailwind-plugin] can help speed you up even more by
providing you with easy to use media variants such as `media-paused:opacity-0`.

This example demonstrates setting up your custom video player layout with Tailwind CSS using Vidstack Player
Web Components.
