| `autoplay`                                  | Whether playback should automatically begin as soon as enough media is available to do so without interruption. Sites which automatically play audio (or videos with an audio track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so it should be avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you should make it opt-in (requiring a user to specifically enable it). However, autoplay can be useful when creating media elements whose source will be set at a later time, under user control.                                                                                                               | `boolean`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `false`                  |

This tells us which parts of the media can be played without delay; this is irrespective of whether that part has been downloaded or not. Some parts of the media may be seekable but not buffered if byte-range requests are enabled on the server. Byte range requests allow parts of the media file to be delivered from the server and so can be ready to play almost immediately — thus they are seekable.                                                                                                                                                | `TimeRanges`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `TimeRanges`             |

| `canPlayType`                | Determines if the media provider can play the given `type`. The `type` is generally the media resource identifier, URL or MIME type (optional Codecs parameter).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `(type: string) => CanPlay`                          |
| `captureStream`              | 🧑‍🔬 **EXPERIMENTAL:** Returns a `MediaStream` object which is streaming a real-time capture of the content being rendered in the media element. This method will return `undefined` if this API is not available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `() => MediaStream ∣ undefined`                      |
| `exitFullscreen`             | Requests to exit fullscreen mode, returning a `Promise` that will resolve if the request is successful, or reject with a reason for failure. Refer to `requestFullscreen()` for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `() => Promise<void>`                                |
| `getRequestQueue`            | Returns a clone of the current request queue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `() => ProviderRequestQueue`                         |
| `load`                       | Resets the media element to its initial state and begins the process of selecting a media source and loading the media in preparation for playback to begin at the beginning. The amount of media data that is prefetched is determined by the value of the element's `preload` attribute. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** You should generally not need to call this method as it's handled by the library.                                                                     | `() => void`                                         |
| `lockOrientation`            | Locks the orientation of the player to the desired orientation type using the Screen Orientation API. This method will throw an error if the API is unavailable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `(lockType: ScreenOrientationLock) => Promise<void>` |
| `makeEnterFullscreenRequest` |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `() => Promise<void>`                                |
| `pause`                      | Pauses playback of the media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `() => Promise<void>`                                |
| `play`                       | Begins/resumes playback of the media. If this method is called programmatically before the user has interacted with the player, the promise may be rejected subject to the browser's autoplay policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `() => Promise<void>`                                |
| `requestFullscreen`          | Displays element fullscreen and resolves promise when done. When supplied, options's navigationUI member indicates whether showing navigation UI while in fullscreen is preferred or not. If set to "show", navigation simplicity is preferred over screen space, and if set to "hide", more screen space is preferred. User agents are always free to honor user preference over the application's. The default value "auto" indicates no application preference. | `() => Promise<void>`                                |
| `shouldPlayType`             | Determines if the media provider "should" play the given type. "Should" in this context refers to the `canPlayType()` method returning `Maybe` or `Probably`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `(type: string) => boolean`                          |
| `unlockOrientation`          | Unlocks the orientation of the player to it's default state using the Screen Orientation API. This method will throw an error if the API is unavailable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `() => Promise<void>`                                |
| `waitForRequestQueueToFlush` | Waits for the current request queue to be flushed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `() => Promise<void>`                                |
